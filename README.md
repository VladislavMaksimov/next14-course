# Next.js Course

This small app is based on [the small course](https://youtu.be/wm5gMKuwSYk?si=0uVaaJnB51tbbI3g) of JavaScript Mastery. The lecturer wrote the most amount of code. I changed some components and constants' names, created a search by prompt name, tag, and prompt creator's name, wrote tag-clicking logic, and made users' profiles available for a user or a guest.

In fact, I don't like the code style and some solutions shown in the course. However, I decided not to rewrite the whole codebase because my goal wasn't to make the greatest project of all time but to learn some of the Next.js concepts such as App Router, API Routes, Metadata, etc.
